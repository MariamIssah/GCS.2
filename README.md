This repository explores some of the different ways we can use shell programming in practical ways through record management and automation in shell.
Specifically, this application is a University student email ID system. It is made for managing ID's by creating them, deleting, editing, moving, etc. The feature also works purely for backing up the files and automating some management processes. All the collaborators of this Github contributed to its eventual completion and success. 

To install the application, you clone this repository to your Linux-based system. It is only operational through BASH/Terminal/cmd utilisaiton. 

To run the application, you need to perform "cat ./file_name.sh" to run it. Once running you will have full access to the applications functionality.
